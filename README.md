# MakeupManiac
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Spec:

1. On startup describes the type of a data a user will receive, along with a button, which when clicked calls to the api, and displays the data on screen, replacing the description text with a table or list type view.
2. Allow a user to request more items somehow. This should add to the current list, rather than replacing it
3. Add an input somewhere that, as a user types into it, filters the currently showing results (no need to fetch things based on this).
4. When clicking on an item in this list or table view, navigate to an item specific view that shows a bit more detail.

Please DO NOT use any api wrapping libraries, http libraries or state management tooling. Use fetch for http access and React component state/context for managing state.

Please DO use create-react-app or something like it and a routing library (react-router, router-5, whatever-other-router).

You're welcome to use either JavaScript or Typescript, but please make sure to use modern syntax conventions.

Please style this using your preferred styling methods, we use styled-components, however use what you know best.

We're only going to use the most recent version of chrome for reviewing this, and don't expect it to work flawlessly in every browser ever, so no need to waste time ensuring cross-browser compatibility

## Available Scripts

Once you 'cd' into the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
